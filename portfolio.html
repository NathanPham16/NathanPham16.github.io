            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="text_align_left"> Meja man got into a fight with Proto man!
            Play in a 1v1 2-D fighter with random stages with every fight. The 
            games ends when one of the players health bar depletes. The games is
            only as hard as your opponent!</p><hr>
            <h3>Refection</h3>
            <p class="text_align_left">I was inspired by the new Super Smash Bros.
            game coming out soon and I wanted to recreate a game similar to that
            of. I was proud of the title screen and the movement of each player,
            but I had difficulties with implementing a gravity feeling for jumping 
            and the changing of every single sprite. The process was tedious but
            I was able to push through.</p>

            <img src="More Block Jump.PNG">
            <p class="text_align_left"> This algorithm allows the animation of 
            Meja Man in the home screen.<br> The More Block algorithm allows Meja
            Man to jump.</p><hr>
            <h2 id = "pokemon">Pokemon CYOA</h2>
            <p class="text_align_left">Take an adventure in the world of Pokemon 
            to become the champion of the Hoenn region or a Pokemon collecting 
            master. Choose a starter, battle your rival, and maybe even catch a 
            legendary pokemon, all in choose your own adventure version of the 
            classic Pokemon games.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p class="text_align_left"> One developmental process in the coding of this
            choose your own adventure project that I used was trial and error. I would
            first write all of the code of the program then test it to fix any of the 
            errors that may occur but also improve the code by finding more effective 
            ways to shorten and simplify it. Another process I used to improve this
            project is revisiting the code as I continued to create the program and story.
            As I was creating programming the project, I would come across new techniques
            and return back to the older codes to implement them there. One difficulty I had
            was trying to set a variable that would allow one's decision to affect them
            later in the adventure. I learn that setting variables to global allows
            thoses variables to be used in other functions. Organizing scenes of your 
            story into functions is a form of procedural abstraction because it seperates
            the user from code into coherent stories. It helps them follow the code and
            differentiates between each choice and path taken. The advantages of 
            abstracting your scenes into functions are that it helps organizes thoughts
            into specific chunks of code rather than all confusing and all together.
            One story I liked was the Peppa the pig because it was a very cute and funny 
            story.</p>
