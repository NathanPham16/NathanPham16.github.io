            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="text_align_left"> Meja man got into a fight with Proto man!
            Play in a 1v1 2-D fighter with random stages with every fight. The 
            games ends when one of the players health bar depletes. The games is
            only as hard as your opponent!</p><hr>
            <h3>Refection</h3>
            <p class="text_align_left">I was inspired by the new Super Smash Bros.
            game coming out soon and I wanted to recreate a game similar to that
            of. I was proud of the title screen and the movement of each player,
            but I had difficulties with implementing a gravity feeling for jumping 
            and the changing of every single sprite. The process was tedious but
            I was able to push through.</p>

            <p class="text_align_left"> This algorithm allows the animation of 
            Meja Man in the home screen.<br> The More Block algorithm allows Meja
            Man to jump.
